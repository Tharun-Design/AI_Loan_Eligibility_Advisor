# AI Loan Eligibility Advisor

An intelligent web application that estimates **loan eligibility, EMI capacity, and financial risk** using real-world banking logic such as FOIR, debt-to-income ratio, and credit score evaluation.

This project simulates how financial institutions assess a loan applicant's repayment capacity.

# Project Overview

Before applying for a loan, it is important to understand whether the application is financially feasible.

This tool helps users:

• Estimate the maximum loan amount they can afford  
• Calculate a safe EMI range  
• Evaluate financial risk  
• Receive AI-style financial advice  

The system uses commonly used banking metrics to generate realistic estimations.

# Financial Logic Used

The estimator uses several real-world banking principles.

### FOIR (Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio)

Banks typically allow **50% of income** to go toward debt obligations.

### Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)

Measures total financial obligation relative to income.

### EMI Safety Cap

A single new loan EMI should not exceed **40% of income**.

### Interest Rate Based on Credit Score

| Credit Score | Category | Interest Rate |
|--------------|----------|--------------|
| 300–550 | Poor | 15% |
| 550–650 | Fair | 13% |
| 650–750 | Good | 11% |
| 750+ | Excellent | 9.5% |

# Loan Calculation Model

Loan eligibility is calculated using the **annuity formula** used by banks.

Loan Amount Formula:

```
P = EMI × (1 − (1+r)^−n) / r
```

Where

- P = Loan Amount
- r = Monthly Interest Rate
- n = Number of Months
